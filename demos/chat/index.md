## Details

Chat applications are the "Hello World" of real-time architecture.  This example will use a browser to present a Web-based chat room.  The room can be viewed on desktop, tablet, and smartphone devices.

At its core, a chat application consists of a field to enter a message, and an area to view the messages that have been sent.  Put those two fields in an HTML page, the Gateway library, and a splash of additional code, and you will have a secure, Web-based, chat.  Styling is accomplished through CSS, and can be easily modified to match your branding.

Gateway supports multiple platforms including Android and iOS.  You can use those libraries to provide native applications as well as the Web-based one presented here.

To learn more about how to build this simple chat application, read the [Building a Chat Application - Hello World](/blog/building-a-chat-application) blog post.
