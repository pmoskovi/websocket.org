summary: Drive a Formula One racer car with your smartphone
---

## Details

Control a WebGL Formula One car on your desktop from the Web browser of your smart phone by simply tilting it. No browser extension or application installation needed. Works over any network, such as WiFi, 4G, or LTE.

There are some solutions out there that turn your smartphone into a Wii-style controller, but many of them require a dedicated app on your phone and even a browser plugin on your desktop. With HTML5 and WebSockets you can achieve this very quickly and easily without the need of pre-installing anything on your machine or your phone. All you need to drive the car on the screen is tilt your phone left and right, forward and backward.

To try it out, click the Live Demo button below, and point the web browser on your smartphone to the URL provided on the bottom of the screen.
